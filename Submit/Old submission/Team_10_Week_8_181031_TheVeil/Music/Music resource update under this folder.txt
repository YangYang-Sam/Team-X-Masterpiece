All updates to audio will be contained here to keep track of work completed and what assets are available for implementation within game or still to be 
implemented within the Unity/Wwise logic structure

Up until this point we have been implementing sound within the Unity engine - using the Wwise structure from this point to allow for more sophisticated 
application of sound.

To this date we have within the game: 

- 1. 'Music loop' to later be used as the menu screen, currently acting as placeholder for the level.
- 2. A 'Jump' and 'Jump2' sound triggered by jumping and dbl jumping (spacebar) respectively. 
- 3. A 'VeilJump' sound triggered with by pressing the 'W' key (core mechanic.)
- 4. A 'Key' noise which currently functions as a placeholder for the portal noise (later to be heard when collecting keys throughout level.)

To this date we have have sounds ready to implement:

- 1. 'CreditSequence' to be heard upon completing the game.
- 2. 'Enemynoise' x3 SFX to be triggered randomly when player's character is nearby associated enemy (to function as a form of audable warning)
     this noise will be EQ'd within Wwise to be heard muffled when player is in adjacent plane to that of the enemy.
- 3. 'GreenGoo' a bubbling/acidic noise to be heard when nearby acid hazourdous to the character (again functioning as a warning.)
- 4. A 'RotatingPlane' noise to be heard when player activates lever which rotates adjacent planes, slow and grinding, then locking in place.
- 5. 'PortalA' Sound to be triggered when activating one of the 3 portals (Sound affect ends with a musical tone, consequent portals will result in 
     different tones to be heard, ensuring variation and satisfaction as player when moving between portals quickly results in a musical progression.)
- 6. 'TxtSpeech' blips to be heard as text arrives on-screen (possibly not in final build?)

Sound/Music still to be designed/composed:

- 1. 3 Seperate music loops 45seconds-1minute each (roughly:) They will each trigger when in any one of the 3 planes. Moving between planes will trigger
     the current track to end and the other to begin.
- 2. 6 very-short transition pieces of music to help soften the move between each loop and remain musically satisfying (not-jarring.) This 
     interaction/implementation will be one of the core audio-game mechanics which ensure satisfying gameplay.
- 3. Various audio to accompany key enemy animations eg. Skeleton throwing a 'rib-boomerang.'
- 4. Sounds to be triggered upon 'Raven's' death or the successful completion of the level.

As the game progresses and evolves further sounds will be designed to accompany new mechanics/assets etc, current lists discuss largely audio
deemed highest priority.
The next step is to implement Wwise within Unity and begin creating the logic structures for when sounds will be triggered and how they might 
evolve over time/react to player's actions within the game. This will make further changes/additions to audio within the game easier and more impactful.
